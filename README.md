# manu-scripts
comparative page-view / markup tool for 15th c. manuscripts (24? partial volumes)

## coming soon
+ my partner works on medieval metrics and asked me to clean one of his excel spreadsheet of missing/partial/alternate folio paginations
+ i said sure (love graphic refinements), once your research assistants have input their data...
+ but we could also make a tool that meaningfully collates/tracks visual page mark-up and allow for an integrated presentation (and metric overview) of manuscript forms
+ and 'poof', dh sketching commenced.
